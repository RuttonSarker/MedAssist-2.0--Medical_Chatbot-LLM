This project focuses on developing a Medical Chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), hosted on a cloud infrastructure, to address inefficiencies in current healthcare delivery systems. The chatbot will serve as a virtual assistant, providing users with accurate, real-time responses to health-related inquiries. By delivering instant information, the system aims to reduce wait times and improve the overall patient experience, particularly in high-demand environments where access to healthcare professionals is limited.

Beyond patient support, the chatbot will assist healthcare providers by handling routine and repetitive queries, allowing medical professionals to focus on complex cases that require human expertise. This task delegation enhances workflow efficiency within clinics and hospitals. The chatbot will be accessible across devices via cloud deployment, ensuring availability at any time and location, thereby promoting global healthcare equity.

Furthermore, the system will be designed to adapt and improve over time by learning from user interactions through continuous feedback loops. This scalability and adaptability make the chatbot a sustainable and evolving solution. Overall, the project not only enhances the quality of healthcare services but also leverages cutting-edge AI and cloud technologies to build a responsive, intelligent, and accessible medical support system for users worldwide.
